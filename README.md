# Graph-anonymization
Two algorithms implemented in java to degree anonymization &amp; simplest graph construction

DGAN is the degree greedy anonymization algorithm.
DynamicP contains the dynamic programming degree anonymization algorithm. 
Database contains the the .csv file used to make tests.

The first is the greedy way to anonymize a graph, it's a fast way.
The second methods use dynamic programming, it's slower but find the optimal way to make an original  graph into an anonymized graph.
